# **Academic Integrity Policy**

## 👍 **Allowed Resources:**

- Student Notes (these may be hand-written _or_ typed)
- Documentation (see last section below)
- Lecture slides (try to download these ahead of time!)
- Help tickets (especially in case of specs not running or very basic clarification needed)
- Other curriculum resources (e.g. workshop code, demo code, etc.)
- Search Engines (see below for exceptions)

<!-- ### ⚠️ **Important Caveat to Allowed Resources:**

- **Notes**: Your notes should be the distillation of your understanding of the materials, not large swaths of code samples. To that end:
  - Notes should not contain code blocks from forbidden resources
  - Code blocks you **do** include should be short and new
    - **Short** means about 3 lines of code per associated thought/note block (this is a rough guideline on purpose)
  - **New** means it should be sample code you write fresh representing key ideas, not code passing specific prior test specs or code lifted from workshop solutions
- **Copy & Paste**: All code you write during this checkpoint should be hand-typed, including code samples that come from your allowed resources -->

## 🚫 **Forbidden:**

- Other students' work (including current students and alums)
- Soliciting or accepting help from other students (e.g. via Slack, WhatsApp, Google Chat, text, etc.) during the allotted project time
- Using search engines to seek out solutions to the assigned project

## 📌 **Lastly:**

The purpose of this checkpoint is for you to write code that demonstrates what you've learned so far, and for us to be able to to work with you if there are gaps in your knowledge. Cheating on the test simply to pass it robs all of us of the ability to work together on your journey, and jeopardizes your spot in the program.
