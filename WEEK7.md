**A few notes:**

- It's _best_ if you do Boilermaker **_before_** doing Deployment. Each will build upon concepts in the the previous topic.
- We've also included video links to talks on Agile Software Development, and Giving Feedback, two invaluable soft skills to aid you on your Senior Phase Journey! The videos are optional but encouraged!
