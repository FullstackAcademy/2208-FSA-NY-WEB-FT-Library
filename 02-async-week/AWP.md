# üîé **Async Week Project** üí°

## **What?**

Absolutely anything you want it to be. This is meant to be ‚Äú_fun and playful_.‚Äù If what you deliver is incomplete, **that‚Äôs fine**! Think of this as a very low-stakes sandbox.

For some inspiration, check out this [list of technologies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aApC_9G1tG1q3LfCfliUPHrK7NF2d3K9_Wu4mPT9BpY/edit?usp=sharing) to explore.

## **When?**

It is **due by Friday at 11:59pm (EST) of Async Week**.

## **How?**

Record a **short** (`<= 5` minutes) screencast and upload to YouTube as an **unlisted** video.

Your video submission does **_not_** have to be polished. **At all.** You‚Äôre **_not_** expected to show this to anyone outside of this class. Just think of it as a casual class presentation. Keep it conversational.

On the due date, an instructor will start a thread within the cohort Slack channel.

Share the name of the technology you used, a quick description of what the technology is used for, and the link to your YouTube screencast.

- For example, Slack, "**_D3.js - JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. [insert link here]_**," which can foster a conversation amongst each other like so:
  - ‚ÄúWow I didn‚Äôt know you could do that with D3!‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúThanks, I really liked your Neo4J demonstration. How‚Äôd you get that graph to show up?‚Äù

## **Why?**

**To explore and have fun!** Seriously. This is an opportunity to goof off with **new technology** _without_ any specific expectations. You don‚Äôt have any requirements to fulfill or tests to pass. If your project is unfinished and totally broken, that‚Äôs **perfectly okay**. Just talk about what you learned.
